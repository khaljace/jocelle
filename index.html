    <h2 class="typewriter">A Note for You</h2>
    <div class="content typewriter">
I don’t usually do things like this,
but something about you made me want to try.

I wanted to create something quiet and intentional,
something that doesn’t rush, doesn’t pressure,
and simply exists as honesty.

You’re someone I genuinely admire, not just because you’re cute,
but because you’re thoughtful, intelligent,
and kind in a way that feels rare.

You’re the kind of person who makes me curious in the best way.
Not loud curiosity, not infatuation—
but the kind that makes me want to listen, understand,
and learn more about who you are.

This isn’t meant to impress you.
It’s just me, showing effort in the only way I know how.
    </div>

  <div class="page">
    <h2 class="typewriter">What I admire</h2>
    <div class="content typewriter">
 What I admire about you goes deeper than appearances,
though I won’t pretend you’re not pulchritudinous, because you are.

But what really stands out is the way you think.
The way you carry yourself.
The way conversations with you feel easy,
but never empty.

You strike me as someone who’s thoughtful,
someone who notices things,
someone who understands more than they usually say.

And I really appreciate the way you handled me,
especially during moments when others seemed to step away.
You stayed kind and patient,
and that meant more to me than I probably showed.

That kind of intelligence,
emotional as much as mental—
is rare, and it’s something I genuinely respect.

  <div class="page">
    <h2 class="typewriter">My Intention</h2>
    <div class="content typewriter">
 I want to be clear about something.

I’m not here to rush you,
to overwhelm you,
or to put expectations on you.

My intention is simple:
I’d like the chance to know you better.

Slowly.
Naturally.
With honesty and respect.

Whatever pace feels right for you is the pace I’m willing to take.

    <h2 class="typewriter">This made me really happy 💙</h2>
    <div class="content typewriter">
I won’t lie—this genuinely made me smile.

Thank you for saying yes,
and more importantly, thank you for trusting me enough to.

I’m really looking forward to getting to know you better,
not just the surface things,
but the thoughts you don’t always say out loud,
the stories that matter to you,
and the moments that make you feel most like yourself.

There’s no pressure here.
Just two people taking a step forward,
intentionally and honestly.

I’m glad this step is with you.

      We’ll take things one moment at a time 💙

<!-- TALK MODAL -->
<div class="modal hidden" id="talkModal">
  <div class="modal-box">
    <button class="close">✕</button>
    <h2 class="typewriter">That’s completely okay 💙</h2>
    <div class="content typewriter">
  I really appreciate your honesty.

The fact that you took the time to read through this
already means more than you probably realize.

I’d love the chance to talk,
to learn more about you,
to hear what you think,
and to see where things naturally lead.

There’s no rush.
No expectations.
Just a conversation, whenever you feel comfortable.

I’m here, and I’m patient.
    </div>
     <div class="soft-note typewriter">
     Take all the time you need. I mean that.
